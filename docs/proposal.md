## Summary of the Project
Our Minecraft-AI project will focus on recognizing different characters in Minecraft such as creeper, skeleton, cat, pig, etc, and performing actions on those characters which depend on the rule that we make (for example kill anything but cats). The input will be agent's view at current time, and a set of rules. Our model will predict whether there is a character in the agent's view. The model predicts which character it is and perform an action according to the rule set that we give.
## AI/ML Algorithms
We are planning to combine computer vision with machine learning to determine whether the object of interest is in the view of the agent and use reinforment learning to decide on the action of the agent.
