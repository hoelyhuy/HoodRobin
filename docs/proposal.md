## Summary of the Project
Our Minecraft-AI project will focus on recognizing different characters in Minecraft such as creeper, skeleton, cat, pig, etc, and performing actions on those characters which depend on the rule that we make (for example kill anything but cats). The input will be agent's view at current time, and a set of rules. Our model will predict which character is in the agent's view and perform an action according to the rule set that we give beforehand.
## AI/ML Algorithms
We are planning to combine computer vision with machine learning to determine which character is in the agent's view and use reinforment learning to take action (aim and shoot if the character is in enemy list, or do nothing if character is not in enemy list).
