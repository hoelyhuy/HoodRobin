<br />
Image labeling tool<br />
https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg<br />
Github link to image detection (using tensor flow)<br />
https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow<br />

Plans for now:<br />
Generate data for training, and lable data using image labeling software (link to software above)<br />
Figure out how to use Collab to train the data (using darkflow, link to darkflow is above)<br />
Hook darkflow with docker and use it there for image detection <br />
