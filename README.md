Some task that we need to figure out:<br />
get the frames from minecraft game and store it in image file (to use for training)<br />
train our data<br />
use our model to predict the objects in minecraft<br />

For game design:<br />
Design our world (for now it does not have to be too fancy, i'm thinking of a square empty land with fence surrounding)<br />
Make our game rule (what to kill and what not to kill)<br />
Write our algorithm to take actions<br />
